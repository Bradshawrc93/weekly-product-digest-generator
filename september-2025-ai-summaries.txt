WEEK 1: Sep 1 - Sep 7, 2025
----------------------------------------
This week, the Core Engineering/ThoughtHub squad made significant strides by implementing a new Document Parser for Principal Finance, enhancing the ability to extract essential information from EOB content, which will streamline operations and improve accuracy in financial processing. They also upgraded KNative Serving to version 1.17.2 and set up cross-account sharing of MSK, addressing connectivity challenges and enhancing system interoperability. The Voice squad focused on improving secret management by transitioning to SOPS, ensuring better security protocols, and optimized payer look-up processes to default to payer codes, thereby increasing efficiency in voice calling requests. Additionally, they initiated a comprehensive analysis of voice workflow capabilities to determine the best approach for future development. The Customer-Facing squad worked on establishing a Product Feedback Framework, aimed at enhancing internal feedback collection mechanisms to inform product improvements. Meanwhile, the HITL squad made progress on various backend functionalities, ensuring foundational systems are in place for future enhancements. Lastly, the Medical Coding team focused on hardening extraction and parsing logic, which is critical for maintaining data integrity and accuracy in coding processes. Overall, these initiatives collectively enhance operational efficiency, security, and product quality, positioning the organization for improved service delivery and customer satisfaction. Additionally, we created 1000 new work items, setting the stage for next week's deliveries. Clean Operations: All systems are running smoothly with no bottlenecks.

WEEK 2: Sep 8 - Sep 14, 2025
----------------------------------------
This week, the Core Engineering/ThoughtHub squad achieved significant technical milestones, including enhancements to the ArgoCD system with improved authentication and notifications for application health monitoring, which will bolster operational reliability and response times. They also advanced the document parser capabilities by conducting vendor testing for LLMOps, ensuring alignment with multimodal requirements. Notably, the team implemented spec drift detection for Access API documentation, enhancing monitoring and alerting through CloudWatch, which mitigates risks associated with API changes. Additionally, the squad focused on security by rotating Robocorp API keys and addressing vulnerabilities in dependencies, reinforcing the integrity of our systems. The Voice squad made impactful adjustments to payment distribution rules, allowing for greater flexibility in initial payment configurations, and enhanced the IVR agent's functionality to utilize payer-specific navigation steps, improving user experience. Meanwhile, the Medical Coding squad updated critical lookup tables and extraction logic, ensuring data accuracy and operational efficiency. Collectively, these efforts not only improve technical performance but also drive business value through enhanced user experience and operational resilience. Additionally, we created 1000 new work items, setting the stage for next week's deliveries. Clean Operations: All systems are running smoothly with no bottlenecks.

Metrics: 38 completed, 1000 created
