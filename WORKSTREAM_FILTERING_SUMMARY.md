# Workstream and Epic Filtering Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented filtering to exclude "Workstream" ticket types from the "stale" and "on Deck" categories while maintaining their presence in changelog, blocked, and shipped categories. Additionally implemented intelligent epic filtering to exclude epics from stale reporting if they have children with recent activity.

## Changes Made

### 1. Jira Connector Updates (`src/connectors/jira.js`)
- **Stale Tickets Query**: Added `AND issuetype != "Workstream"` to exclude Workstream tickets from stale ticket searches
- **Backlog Tickets Query**: Added `AND issuetype != "Workstream"` to exclude Workstream tickets from backlog (on deck) searches
- **Field Updates**: Added `'issuetype'` field to all Jira search methods for consistency and access to ticket type information
- **Epic Children Method**: Added `getEpicChildren()` method to fetch children of epics using Epic Link field
- **Epic Filtering Logic**: Modified `getStaleTickets()` to exclude epics that have children with recent activity (< 15 days)

### 2. Data Organizer Updates (`src/processors/dataOrganizer.js`)
- **New Helper Method**: Added `filterOutWorkstreamTickets()` method to filter out Workstream tickets from issue arrays
- **Applied Filtering**: Updated `organizeSquadData()` to filter Workstream tickets from stale and backlog categories
- **Preserved Other Categories**: Workstream tickets still appear in changelog, blocked, and completed categories

### 3. Metrics Calculator Updates (`src/processors/metricsCalculator.js`)
- **New Helper Method**: Added `filterOutWorkstreamTickets()` method for consistency
- **Stale Metrics**: Applied filtering to stale ticket metrics to ensure accurate counts
- **Preserved Other Metrics**: All other metrics remain unchanged

## Testing Results

### ✅ Successful Tests
1. **Jira Connection**: ✅ Connected successfully
2. **Stale Tickets Filtering**: ✅ 6 tickets found, 0 Workstream tickets in stale category
3. **Epic Filtering**: ✅ 3 epics excluded due to active children, 6 epics remained stale
4. **Backlog Tickets Filtering**: ✅ 47 tickets found, 0 Workstream tickets in backlog category
5. **Blocked Tickets**: ✅ 0 tickets found (Workstream tickets would be included if any existed)
6. **Completed Tickets**: ✅ 1 ticket found (Workstream tickets would be included if any existed)
7. **Data Organizer Filtering**: ✅ Test Workstream ticket properly filtered out
8. **Metrics Calculator Filtering**: ✅ Test Workstream ticket properly filtered out

### 📊 Report Generation
- Successfully generated a test report for Aug 4 - Aug 10, 2025
- Report created in Notion with ID: `250f43a7-8fa4-8168-b78c-cc2135ce2646`
- All filtering applied correctly during report generation
- Epic filtering reduced stale tickets from 9 to 6 (3 epics excluded due to active children)

## Implementation Details

### JQL Query Changes
```sql
-- Before (stale tickets)
status in ("In Progress") AND updated <= -15d

-- After (stale tickets)
status in ("In Progress") AND updated <= -15d AND issuetype != "Workstream"
-- Additional filtering: Epics with active children are excluded programmatically

-- Before (backlog tickets)
status in ("Backlog", "Open")

-- After (backlog tickets)
status in ("Backlog", "Open") AND issuetype != "Workstream"

-- Epic children query
"Epic Link" = "EPIC-KEY"
```

### Filtering Logic
```javascript
// Workstream filtering
filterOutWorkstreamTickets(issues) {
  return issues.filter(issue => {
    const issueType = issue.fields.issuetype?.name;
    return issueType !== 'Workstream';
  });
}

// Epic filtering (in getStaleTickets)
for (const ticket of staleTickets) {
  const issueType = ticket.fields.issuetype?.name;
  
  if (issueType === 'Epic') {
    const children = await this.getEpicChildren(ticket.key);
    const hasActiveChildren = children.some(child => {
      const daysSinceUpdate = DateUtils.daysSinceUpdate(child.fields.updated);
      return daysSinceUpdate < 15; // Consider children active if updated within 15 days
    });
    
    if (!hasActiveChildren) {
      filteredStaleTickets.push(ticket);
    }
  } else {
    filteredStaleTickets.push(ticket);
  }
}
```

## Categories Affected

### ❌ Excluded from (Workstream tickets filtered out)
- **Stale Tickets**: In-progress tickets with no updates in 15+ days
- **On Deck**: Backlog tickets organized by priority

### ✅ Still Included (Workstream tickets remain)
- **Changelog Events**: All ticket updates and status changes
- **Blocked Tickets**: Tickets in blocked status
- **Shipped/Completed**: Tickets moved to Done status
- **New Tickets**: Recently created tickets

### 🎯 Epic Stale Filtering
- **Excluded**: Epics with children updated within 15 days (considered active)
- **Included**: Epics with no children OR all children are also stale (≥ 15 days)
- **Logic**: Only report epics as stale if they are truly stagnant (no active child work)

## Branch Information
- **Branch Name**: `exclude-workstream-from-stale-ondeck`
- **Commit Hash**: `616e94e`
- **Status**: Ready for review and deployment

## Next Steps
1. Review the generated test report in Notion
2. Validate that Workstream tickets are properly excluded from stale and on deck sections
3. Confirm Workstream tickets still appear in other categories as expected
4. Approve changes for merge to main branch
5. Deploy to production environment
